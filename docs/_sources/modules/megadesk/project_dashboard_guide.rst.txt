Project Dashboard
+++++++++++++++++++

Clicking into any Project will pull up the Project Specific Dashboard. This will show you information specific to the project for each user. This menu will give more detail than the previous menu as it only displays one project at a time. There are several items here that have been left for future development and will hence not be totally functional for the time being.

The side menu is a collapsible panel that will display current and short term information  to the user. This aims to encourage action on outstanding timecards, document reviews,  approvals & information on hours worked for a job. It has been left open for some other future Odoo projects such as Task Board integrated items including TQs, NCRs, Purchase Orders and Variations. This is still very much a work in progress.
