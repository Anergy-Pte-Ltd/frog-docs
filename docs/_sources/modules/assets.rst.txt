Overview
********

**Plant** is the physical manifestation/deliverable to be performed/provided/operated/maintained in a contract/job.

**Plant** only contain *Assets*. These are the logical and physically separable parts.

**Assets** may contain *sub-assets* and most likely have *connections* to other assets.



**Assets** are an abstract class only. Of particular note, **Equipment** is
the set of **Assets** which are part of the *equipment* category, **Instruments** are the set of **Assets** which are
part of the *instrument* category.

Asset
*****

**Assets** are an abstract model that require subclassing.

An **Asset**:

- *belongs* to another **Asset** or is actually a **Plant** instance (which is a subclass of asset)
- must be instantiated as a subclass which in turn will define the *class* of the **Asset**
- through this subclass will have a **tag** (see individual subclasses)
- *is* a *type* which is one of **Asset Types**
- *has* a *status* which is one of:
    - NEW (default) | IN PROGRESS | COMPLETE | ON HOLD | DELETED
- *has* a *reason* for *status* when status is either ON HOLD or DELETED
- *has* a *created* timestamp - set on creation of task - cannot be changed
- *has* a *started* timestamp
    - set when task *status* is made not NEW
    - can also be manually changed
    - must be before a task in *completed*
- *has* **asset properties**
- *may have* one or more **notes**
- *could be* a *template* meaning that the **Asset** *cannot* be allocated to

Asset Properties
================

**Asset Properties** are unstructured data. That is it is not possible to define each and every property and it is
possible for these to be able to be

.. note::

    Suggested here that the asset properties be designed to be similar to JSON.

..  note::

    Asset properties will be actually dynamic and computable as well as addressable. To do this, the Python package
    ``pint`` will be used to allow the property to be parsed and a quantity. For example, you can call upon design
    criteria information and use that in the calculation of a value at equipment level.

Asset Template
==============

**Asset Template** is


Asset Types
===========

The following is a list of **Asset Types** however this can be extended. Note that the list is String only at this
stage.

Type Name               Hint
======================= ==============================================================================================
Equipment               Mechanical equipment
Structure               Structural elements including concrete and steelwork
Infrastructure          Earthworks, buried services and buildings
Electrical Equipment    Electrical equipment generally panels
Instrumentation         Instruments used within the process (in the field)
Piping                  Pipe lines and associated works
Control Software
Document


- Equipment
- Structure
- Infrastructure

**Asset Types** contain:

- title of the type; and
- a description/hint of the type (for use within help)

Plant
*****

A **Plant**:

- *belongs* to a **Site**
- *has* a **Geolocation**
- *has* a *title*
- *has* a *description*
- *has* a *design timestamp*
- *has* a *commission timestamp*
- *has* a *decommission timestamp*
- *has* many *assets*
- is *linked* to one or more *contracts* or *proposals*
- *has* a *plant status* which is one of:
    - FUTURE | IN CONSTRUCTION | IN PRODUCTION | IN EXTENSION | IN CARE & MAINTENANCE | DECOMMISSIONED
- *has* a list of **areas** for the plant
- *has* schemas for:
    - **Document Numbers**
    - **Equipment Tags**
    - **Instrument Tags**
    - **Structural Element Tags**
    - **Pipe Line Numbers**
    - **Valve Numbers**
    - **Electrical Equipment Tags**
    - **Electrical Cable Tags**


Plant Area
==========

An **Area** is generally deemed to be a geographical zone of the Plant though in some cases it is possible that it
could be assumed to be functional during early stages of design. It is possible that assets will change areas based
on the actual layout through the design process.

An **Area**:

- *belongs* to a **Plant**
- *has* a *number* for display purposes
- *has* a *number* for tag usage purposes
- *has* a *title*
- *has* a *status* which is as per the **plant status**

**Areas** are ordered by their display numbers.


Plant Status
============

Defintion of *plant status* is as follows:

:FUTURE:                No commitment yet made but a possibility

:IN CONSTRUCTION:       Commitment made and going through realisation including design, procurement and construction

:IN PRODUCTION:         Completed works and no contracts pending

:IN EXTENSION:          Completed works with contracts pending to modify/expand/extend existing/adjacent facility

:IN CARE & MAINTENANCE: No work either in capital or operation taking place but facility in tact

:DECOMMISSIONED:        Facility no longer able to be used to produce

Equipment
*********

An **Equipment** (which sounds better if we say "Item of Equipment" or "Equipment Item" given that Equipment is a
plural):

- is an **Asset**
- *has* a *tag* which is an **Equipment Tag** (see below)
- *has* a set of **asset properties**




Equipment Tags
==============

These are a type of **Business Identifier** for which the schema is configured with each Plant. There are multiple
existing schemas for this identifier but in general they follow the following pattern:

    EE-AN[d]

Where:

    EE = Two letter description of the equipment type. This is in accordance with a standard list
    A = Area Number
    N = Sequential Number typically starting from 0 to 9
    d = Optional letter suffix when the equipment is part of a set which is otherwise identical.

See the testing below for references to examples.

Instrument
==========


Instrument Tags
---------------

These are a type of **Business Identifier** for which the schema is configured with each Plant. The schema follows
the ISA 5.1 numbering scheme for instruments adapted for each project. This will be the following pattern.

Document
========

A document is an asset to be produced ie a deliverable. Some documents may or may not require actual delivery to
customers.

A **document**:

- *has* a **document number** which must be a document number (as given below)
- *

Testing
*******

The following projects each are of a plant design performed by Anergy. The data model shall be able to accomodate the
plant information from each of these. This can be done initially as a thought experiment (simple check without
application). Those marked with an asterisk shall require data uploading during the alpha phase testing.
