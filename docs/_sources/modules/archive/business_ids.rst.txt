Business Identifiers
====================

Business Identifiers are identifiers of records which are used by both machine and humans. Each identifier typically
is further defined using a code system. Using this code system, additional information can be determined by any given
identifier rather than merely the actual record that is being recorded.

Typically encoding of identifiers follows one of three patterns:

- Sequential
- Encoded to be human readable
- Random

Only randomly given identifiers (for example UUID's) can genuinely contain no other information other than which
resource is being identified. Even sequential identifiers can give off metadata about the record (see
`German Tank Problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem>`_ if interested).

The business identifiers are all encoded form and further are typically designed allow merely the identifier not only
to signify the resource, but the type of resource.

For example:
