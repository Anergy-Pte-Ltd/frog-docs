Project Dashboard
=================

Objective
---------
The primary goal of the Project Context Dashboard is to is to act as a workspace for each project, giving all users relevant data specific to each job. Inside the portal there should be differing views depending on the status of the user; either a Project Manager or a Project User (Member).  The Project Specific Portal will expand upon the information provided on the Project Centre Dashboard as more room is created by only displaying information related to one project at a time.

Modules Affected
----------------
The following modules will be affected as a result of the implementation of the Project Specific Portal,

    * Document/Transmittal Module;and
    * Current Jobs Module.

Views & Actions
---------------
The following concept views shall be implemented to the Project Centre module:

**Project Centre Dashboard**

|projectdashboard|

Once a user has selected a job from the Project Centre Dashboard, the user will see the view above showing the Project Context Dashboard. In this view, everything has been contextualised to the job number whilst also showing information unique to the user for that job. Menu Button boxes will be implemented will direct the user to pages already filtered to the job number. Note that the blue menu button boxes shall be available to all users while project managers shall have access to both the yellow and blue boxes. Some of these menu button boxes shall be implemented further down the Turbo implementation timeline.

Job Tiles have been included to show tasks, document approvals/reviews and other information relevant to the specific job for the user. This will allow users to access tasks that have been assigned to the user quickly. Room has also been made on the view to allow for future module implementation into the dashboard.

*Actions*

The following actions are available from this view,

*Security*

Users will be able to access job tiles only if they have been added to the job by the Project Management Team. All data shown in the analytics side menu shall only be user context sensitive and not show information related to other users.

*Testing*

.. note::
    This has not been developed and is a work in progress. Will be implemented at a later stage.
