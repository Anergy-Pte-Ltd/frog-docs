    **Author**:   Matthew Martella
    **Updated**:   23/11/2021

Objective
=========

    Modify and enhance the original project module from the community and enterprise editions to:

        - Cover all types of work by Anergy
        - Provide an effective interface to the work as required



Proposed Model
==============

Basic Model
------------





project (*module level*)
    At the module/model level shall mean the collection and hierarchy of work objects as defined by this list of
    definitions




work
    Work is the past, present and future discharge of all tasks, costs and potential obligations within the business.
    Work is arranged in a tree hierarchy such that:
    --parent elements are completely defined by **all** child elements
    --only childless elements can have **tasks** or **costs** attached
    --all elements have unique identifiers (**WID**) for their level
    --the identifiers of all elements belong to a specific **scheme** which can add additional meta-data

AllWork
    HeadWork
        WorkPart
            Task
                SubTask

            SPEC[SpecialProjects] --> SW[Spec Project Work] -. TBA .-> SW ----> TASKS
