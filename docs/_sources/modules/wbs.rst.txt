Work Breakdown Structure Module
===============================

The following definitions are provided for clarification of intent.
<dl>

<dt>WBS</dt>
<dd>WBS stands for <span style="color:palegoldenrod">Work Breakdown Structure</span>. There is ambiguity here. Some will
consider that the WBS is the code to which each item is attributed to, but more technically it encapsulates the
<u>ENTIRE</u> list. The Work Breakdown Structure Identifier (otherwise the WBSId or WID) is the actual code used. A
single WBS exists for a single job.</dd>

<dt>WBS Identifier / WID</dt>
<dd>The Work Breakdown (Structure) Identifier (WID) is a unique identifier for every element in a WBS. Each identifier
must be consistent with the WBS Schema (WBSS). Each identifier will be human and machine readable and will be used
to identify a particular element of work.</dd>

<dt>Work Element</dt>
<dd>Elements are identified in the WBS using a WID. All information pertaining to a job/project that requires work
by the organisation shall reference a work element using the WID. Elements come together in a hierarchy. The
Standard WBS Schema defines three levels to this hierarchy defined as follows:
<dl>
<dt>Division</dt>
<dd>The division element is a sweeping group of sections. Whilst divisions can be relatively arbitrary, experience
shows divisions work best when they group sections and scopes on the basis of commonality of resources to be used
and the timephase of the project.
</dd>
<dt>Section</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
<dt>Scope</dt>
<dd>... All tasks belong to Scope elements only. Given that a Timesheet is supposed to represent the task to which
someone is working on, Timesheet codes must be to a Job and WID combination which points to a scope element.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt>WBS Schema</dt>
<dd>The WBS Schema is a coding schema for the WBS Identifier (WID). The schema identifies the method by which the
code implies the Division, Section and or Scope of the work item identified.</dd>

<dt>WBS Templates</dt>
<dd>This is a template which is should be used during the initiation of a job. This is based on standard means</dd>

</dl>


## Standard Project WBS Schema

The standard code format is:
<pre style="color:palegoldenrod">
A40-40 : Example code
| |  |
| |  └--> Scope part
| └-----> Section part
└-------> Division part
</pre>

A code is valid having a length of 0 (empty or root work element of a job), 1 (a division element), 3 (a section
element) or 6 (a scope element).

The division is predefined and is one of:

* `A - Project Management & Administration` - Includes all work required for the project management and administration
  functions.
* `D - Design & Engineering` - Includes work to be performed by the design and engineering teams but generally limited
  any works before Construction and Commissioning. As Built and further documentation is included instead under
  Commissioning & Completion.
* `M - Material Supply` - ...
* `S - Site Construction` - ...
* `C - Commissioning & Completion` - ...


## Standard Spares WBS Schema
A spares schema assumes that there is only one Division and one Section - These are therefore silent. As such
the code format is as follows:
<pre style="color:palegoldenrod">
01 : Example code
|
└--> Scope part
     Section part assumed to be Blank
     Division part assumed to be Blank
</pre>
Note that older subs used in the ANET system actually comply with this schema.

Other historical schemas include:

* EMRC (T1555) - considerably more sections
* Elan (T1969) - very similar to Standard schema
