|tf| Work Breakdown Structure
#############################

The |tf| project has been broken into an |anergy| standard format for WorkID's but using specialised DIVISIONS to
describe the works.

It is important to understand that a WBS describes the "how" of work breakdown and not necessarily the "what" will be
delivered. :doc:`/ui/applications` covers the details regarding the delivery from the perspective of the user.
However this fails to cover how a project will be managed, administered and what steps may necessarily need to be
taken to get there. This is what a WBS here describes.

   wbs/B
   wbs/C
   wbs/D
   wbs/F
   wbs/G
   wbs/H
   wbs/J
   wbs/M

Note that K and L are reserved for Manufacturing and Operations respectively.
