Welcome to turbo-frog-doc's documentation!
==========================================

|turbo| is the |anergy| implementation of the |odoo| platform. This platform includes a community edition
(or the base components) and an enterprise edition (proprietary extra features and services).

- :doc:`index`

:Application Information:
    This project covers details with regards to applications and how they are supposed to operate. This is primarily a
    User Interface and User Experience oriented specification. Each application is proposed and how the user interface is
    to actually work.

- :doc:`ui/applications`

:Module Information:
    Modules themselves are covered separately. In the various pages here, models and interrelationships between these are
    specified. The information here is intended to be more technical in nature and oriented to the development side.

- `wbs <modules/wbs>`_

:|tf| Project:
    |turbo-frog| of course is a project in it's own right. As such, documents are kept with regards to how the project is
    to operate and the various rules/requirements on project team members, communications, meetings etc.

- `Setup Project <project/access_setup>`_

:How to use reStructuredtext:
    All of the information is written using |rst|. In short, |rst| is a text file that is parsed by a ``builder`` and
    converted into a series of HTML pages, suitable as a web interface. The ``build`` could just as easily convert the
    material into ``pdf`` or ``latex`` formats make the file format very flexible. All files can be natively integrated
    into the |turbo| CMS. The index provides links to useful information in how to write |rst| and use the Sphinx
    ``builder``.
