:Custom Modules:    Limited requirements

Accounts are for multiple companies. The accounts will only deal with **one** company at a time. This will need to be
selected at entry(?) to the app. It also needs to be prominent on the machine.

.. warning::
    This will be a normally closed app open to only workers in this area and

                    | ``D05`` - Leave

:|odoo| Modules:    A few ... need to list
:Custom Modules:    Nil at this stahe ... require some work arounds

Accounts are for multiple companies. The accounts will only deal with **one** company at a time. This will need to be

Forecasting
----------------------------

:|tf| WorkID:       | ``C09`` - Cash Flow
:|odoo| Modules:    Not known
:Custom Modules:    Nil at this stahe ... require some work arounds
:Custom Python:     ``cash cast`` and other type software required

The forecasting module is to present a three-way forecast of the business using expected sales, expected works and
credit arrangements to provide balance sheet, profit and loss and cash flow analysis. It's also expected that the
module will be able to perform this at a project by project level. It is also expected that most of this work will be
on a proprietary basis using standard accounting principles.

.. warning::
    This will be a strictly closed app open to senior managers **only** _except_ for projects.

Consolidation
---------------------------------------

:|tf| WorkID:       | ``C08`` - Group Accounts
:|odoo| Modules:    ``consolidation``
:Custom Modules:    Allowance for Intercompany procedures

Create a consolidated group report of the financials using this app. Should be a case of configuring only the
original |odoo| module. Not 100% certain if the intercompany procedures needs to end up going into here or elsewhere.

.. warning::
    Only available to those involved with Group-wide Accounting.

Analytics
---------------------------

:|tf| WorkID:       | ``<TBA>`` - Unknown
:|odoo| Modules:    --unknown--
:Custom Modules:    --unknown--

.. warning::
    This app will need to be secured with authority only as delegated to an individuals position.

Makes available data from all (at least as limited by the app) models for analysis. Includes:

- data graphing / visualisation etc.

Cost Manager
---------------------------------------------------------

:|tf| WorkID:       | ``<TBA>`` - Unknown
:|odoo| Modules:    --unknown--
:Custom Modules:    --unknown--

Activities and tasks which are performed inside the organisation which can not be attributed directly or not in any
practical way indirectly must go to a cost center. This app is for those managing these centers, identifying their
budgets and approving any costs. Cost centers are hierarchical in nature therefore cost centers can actually be
further broken down including delegated to individuals.

Includes:

- Budget setting
- Timesheet approvals
- Timesheet analysis
- Cost analysis
- Purchase order approval(?)
- Employee expense approval
- Dashboard / Report for cost center
- Cost breakdown management (similar to WBS but within a specific cost code)

It is expected that this will leverage much of the work that will be in the companion
:ref:`/ui/projects/apps:Project_Manager`.

.. note::
    Each cost breakdown point actually can become it's own cost center with a delegate thereafter.

.. warning::
    Limited access to those who own or are delegated authority to examine a cost center. Cost centers are any permanent
    internal codes.
