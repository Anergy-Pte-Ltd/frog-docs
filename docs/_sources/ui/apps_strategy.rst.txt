Strategic Management Apps
==========================

.. toctree::

|scorecard| Scorecard
--------------------------

.. note::
    This is intended to be a 'read-only' app for all but a very few who get involved with setting and finalising the
    scorecard for each period.

Will need a nice title but intended to contain a strategic view of the business. The scorecard will not necessarily
show live information but information curated and then published. The preparation will access live data then enabling
the publisher to snapshot the data and provide any additional wording around the data.


|board| Board
----------------

.. warning::
    Extremely important that any content relating to this site be kept secure

Site for publishing and minuting information required in the governance of the Group. Particularly this will require
information be published and be authorised / signed-off by various parties (as necessary) in order to create the
necessary trail of information. Effectively a glorified CMS.
