Administration and General Apps
=================================

.. toctree::


|admin|

.. _`admin_app`:

Admin
---------------

:|tf| WorkID:       | ``D03`` - Timesheets
                    | ``D04`` - Attendance
                    | ``D05`` - Leave
                    | ``D08`` - Expenses
:|odoo| Modules:    Various
:Custom Modules:    Considerable to get working right
:Custom Python:     Required to interface with Google Maps API (Attendance)
:Custom Javascript: Required for geolocation work (Attendance)

General administration for each employee. Currently |odoo| has these as multiple apps. However this is not seen as
potentially efficient given the number of additional apps in the whole suite. Therefore these items have been rolled
in together. Employees will be expected to check in with this at least several times a week.

Includes:

- Timesheet entry
- Attendance 'clock'
- Leave applications
- Expense entry and submission

.. note::
    This will be open and compulsory to all employees

.. note::
    Tim OByrne would like to incorporate a dashboard landing ... would this be the place? Or would it be best to create
    a new app call say ``home`` which would specifically be the landing page.


|contacts| Contacts
------------------------

:|tf| WorkID:       ``Not allocated`` - Contacts
:|odoo| Modules:    Considerable ... not listed here
:Custom Modules:    Limited requirements

Accounts are for multiple companies. The accounts will only deal with **one** company at a time. This will need to be
selected at entry(?) to the app. It also needs to be prominent on the machine.

.. warning::
    This will be a normally closed app open to only workers in this area and

|reports| Reports
---------------------

:|tf| WorkID:       ``H05`` - Progress Reporting
:|odoo| Modules:    ``website_cms`` (?) or other
:Custom Modules:    Uncertain but could be reasonable

This is a weekly/monthly reporting cycle area. An individual writes their summary and then has 'attached' various
links to reports in various modules.

Possibly needs to be then a review/marking/feedback function to individuals.

|safety| Safety
---------------------------------------

:|tf| WorkID:       ``H13`` - Safety
:|odoo| Modules:    nil
:Custom Modules:    Required

Safety module will include:

- Managing safety incidents and safety contacts
- Displaying safety policies (for locations)
- Developing safety management plans and systems around these
- Incident reporting
- Incident investigation
- JSA development
- Method statement development
- Take 5 implementation
- Safety CMS for information regarding safe work

..  note::
    It is hard to say whether this app is genuinely necessary or not at this level.
