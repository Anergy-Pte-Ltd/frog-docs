|anergy| Project Management
*****************************

Introduction
============

**Project Management** is in an of itself a complex and very large topic. It covers many facets and in the end tends to
be very situational ... that is *one size does not fit all*.

This series of documents is therefore not aimed at trying to create a definitive tome with regards to best practises
in the field of Project Management. It is intended for |anergy| and |turbo| users to be able create a common
understanding of the principles underpinning the method of Project Management adopted as the Company standard.

The Project Management Triangle
-------------------------------

Before going any further it is important to raise the ever important triangle of project management.

    scope
    time
    cost

    scope <--> time
    time <--> cost
    cost <--> scope



There will be constant and ever present tension between the time, cost, scope forces in a Project. So much so that
the common phrase is *"you can have it fast, cheap or complete but you can't have all three"*. In essence, the
**goal** of **project management** is actually to achieve just that - on time, on budget and complete!

Meeting the Goal
----------------

OK - we've formulated our goal. Now how are we going to get into meeting this? This is where there are many, many
answers. These are situational ... what works best in one situation does not work the best in another. Two typical
tools are well known to many:

- The budget; and
- The schedule

Budget for certain will tell us if have our costs under control and of course the schedule will magically inform us
when the project will be complete.

Neither tool however works without fundamentally understanding the scope of a Project. Too often it is stated that
well it's just a repeat of XYZ with a couple of changes. But what was XYZ? How was XYZ achieved? What are the changes
- the delta - between XYZ and what we are doing? This is a vague approach which does not provide control.

Going back to the **budget** and the **schedule** and using the above `she'll be right` approach - what happens when
one of the three parameters goes out of whack? Time is looking not so good. Costs seem to be endless. Wait, we didn't
actually have to do that (or oh s%$# we forgot to do that).

We need a far better understanding of the scope of a project. At this point the need is to examine the anatomy of a
project.

Anatomy of a Project
--------------------

A project itself is made up of many parts. The simplest and most intuitive breakdown looks at it from the point of
view of *who* performs the works. For the building of Fixed Plant, this means the tendancy to look at it from the
following perspective:

        Need to sort things out?



The problem however here is that the **object** of what needs to be produced needs to be transferred to each
**subject**. By this, let's take an example of a pump. A pump needs to be first defined, then specified and designed,
procured, installed and finally commissioned as a part of the entire system. But this will only be one of many, many
objects. In fact, the initial design will consider a system, say cooling water. As part of the design process, it is
decided a pump is required. Along of course with pipes, a cooling tower and heat exchangers. We can't define the
piping however until the cooling tower is selected. But wait ... isn't this procurement? Does that mean our above
pattern no longer works?

Whilst the above pattern creates a genuine series of steps inside the project, it cannot form a basis behind a
genuine anatomy. We'll end up with more exceptions than rules!


Work Breakdown Structure
------------------------

At this point, a concept - familiar to some but unfamiliar to others - of work breakdown needs to be introduced. The
**work breakdown structure** (or WBS for short) takes the scope and breaks it into constituent parts.
