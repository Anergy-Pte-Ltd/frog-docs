|tf| Development Lifecycle
==========================

Each |tf| wbs work scope follows a typical development life cycle. This document explains the methodology that will be
used in developing through deployment and maintenance of |turbo| modules.

The following diagram summarises the development process.

        DESIGN

        IMPLEMENT

        ALPHA TEST

        BETA TEST

        PRODUCTION

All tasks are assigned to a Work ID of the :doc:`Project WBS<breakdown>` and to one of the above phases.

Design
------

A specification is to be written for a module or even a group of modules. The specification should take note of the
following:

:Title:
    Title of the specification / module / group of modules.

:Aim:
    A brief description of what is expected to be achieved by the module / group of module

:References:
    | WorkID's to which the work belongs (typically should be one)
    | Any existing |turbo| or |odoo| modules which will achieve this outcome or need to be inherited
    | Any third party or other works that are potentially affected
    | Any predecessors for the work

:Models:
    | Prose description of what information is to be used
    | Include references to other models from other works if needed
    | Definitions of any terms used in the specification as well

:User Interface:
    | Any notes regarding the user interface
    | Will typically be brief comments only

:Alpha Testing:
    | Either What tests need to be done or How the tests will be developed

:Deployment:
    | Any specific requirements for deployment and the deployment plan

:Issues:
    | Any further notes regarding problems that may be faced in the process

The specification should be confirmed by stakeholders including (but not necessarily limited to) the developers, the
target users and the respective management of that group.

Implementation
--------------

To enter this phase, a plan should be prepared prior to commencement. A plan will list:

:Repo:
    Where the code/information will be stored

:Tasks:
    What tasks are involved

:Unit Tests:
    Any unit tests or other works required at the development stage

:Special Requirements:
    Any special requirements for the work at hand

Tasks will have a Work Id, a description of the task, the phase for the tasks and the expected time to complete the
tasks.


Alpha Testing
-------------

Alpha testing shall be conducting a qualitative series of tests (defined typically in a checksheet) and having these
conducted by someone other than the developer. For the alpha phase to be completed, all tests must be checked off.
Any actions as a result of the testing should be marked as tasks as per the implementation tasks but instead assigned
to the "Alpha Testing" Phase.

All testing shall be conducted on the development server.


Beta Testing
------------

Once alpha testing is complete and approval is given by the Project Manager, the deployment plan will be implemented.
If needs be, access shall only be given to specific Beta testers.

During the Beta testing phase, any issues raised will need to be converted to tasks (as "Beta" tasks) and completed.
The issue raising process shall be the same as given under Production below.
