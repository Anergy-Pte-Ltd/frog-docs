|turbo| Documentation
==========================================

The writing of documentation for |turbo| involves two separate projects:

1. |turbo| User Docs
2. |turbo-frog| Project Docs (to which this belongs)

All documentation is being written in ReStructured Text or RST. The Python package Sphinx is used to build the
documentation into one of several forms. Firstly is the

Access to the Project Docs
=============================

.. note::
    This is not developed. Need a means of accessing the docs online. Docs need to be limited to the ``anergy.com``
    google domain. Need to be able to upload these easily (maybe a python script) so that can be run as a simple command
    from the command line on completion. Would also be good to have auto revision updating and notification of those in
    need.

Getting Involved
================

It will be important to have multiple people writing documentation in the implementation and ongoing works of |turbo|
. This section provides information about how to install the relevant project locally so that it is possible to get
involved. Also provided is a primer on how rst works.

Setting up the |turbo|-docs Project
-----------------------------------

.. note::
    Yet to be developed. This will most likely be using ``Notepad++`` method as outlined for Spencer on Friday. Note
    that the sharing of these docs currently will be through ``Google Drive`` and note ``git``/``gitHub``. Of benefit is
    that project members can be non-technical. Negatively, it reduces the flexibility in automating/improving work flow
    in developing documentation.

Setting up the |turbo-frog|-docs Project
----------------------------------------



This relies upon the ``gsutil`` being installation. Instructions can be found at
`<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil>`_. With ``gsutil`` command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd turbo-frog-doc\_build
    $ gsutil rsync -r -m html gs://working-frog/turbo-frog-docs

Primer on reStructured Text
---------------------------

.. note::
    Set up a series of links and information sources to assist in finding relevant sources of assistance on creating
    and editing resturctured text. Also need links to Sphinx and perhaps even Latex (for pdf development).
